## Building Blocks Implementation Analysis

### 1. **Sequence Building Block**
```cpp
srand(time(0));
int player1_wins = 0;
int player2_wins = 0;
int round_number = 1;
```
- Sequential execution of initialization statements
- Linear flow of dice rolling process
- Step-by-step score calculation and display

### 2. **Selection Building Block (If/Else)**
```cpp
if (dice1 > dice2) {
    cout << "Player 1 wins this round!" << endl;
    player1_wins++;
} else if (dice2 > dice1) {
    cout << "Player 2 wins this round!" << endl;
    player2_wins++;
} else {
    cout << "It's a tie this round!" << endl;
}
```
- Used for round winner determination
- Used for final game winner declaration
- Proper three-way comparison with tie handling

### 3. **Iteration Building Block (While Loop)**
```cpp
while (player1_wins < 2 && player2_wins < 2) {
    // Game round logic
}
```
- Main game loop continues until someone wins 2 rounds
- No arbitrary round limit - game continues as needed
- Proper best-of-3 implementation

### 4. **Logical Operators**
```cpp
while (player1_wins < 2 && player2_wins < 2)
```
- AND operator (&&) used for complex loop condition
- Ensures game continues only while both players have less than 2 wins

### 5. **Random Number Generation**
```cpp
srand(time(0));           // Seed with current time
int dice1 = rand() % 6 + 1;  // Generate 1-6
```
- Proper seeding with time(0) as specified in lecture
- Uses modulo operator for range limitation
- Exactly matches lecture requirement: `rand() % 6 + 1`

## Program Flow Analysis

### **Game Logic Flow:**
1. **Initialization**: Set up random seed and variables
2. **Game Loop**: Continue until winner determined
3. **Round Execution**: Interactive dice rolling for both players
4. **Round Evaluation**: Compare dice and award points
5. **Score Tracking**: Display current standings
6. **Winner Check**: Test if someone reached 2 wins
7. **Game End**: Declare winner and exit

### **Best-of-3 Implementation:**
- âœ… **Correct Interpretation**: First to win 2 rounds wins
- âœ… **No Early Termination**: Game continues until 2 wins achieved
- âœ… **Tie Handling**: Tied rounds don't count toward victory
- âœ… **Fair Competition**: Both players have equal chances

### **Key Features:**
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players press Enter to roll
- **Clear Output**: Round-by-round results and running score
- **Proper Termination**: Game ends exactly when someone wins 2 rounds
- **Simple Design**: Clean, easy-to-understand implementation

## Assignment Requirements Compliance
