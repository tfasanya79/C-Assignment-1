## 1. Problem Description

The assignment required developing a C++ program implementing a dice game where a user challenges the computer. Each player rolls two dice per round, and the highest sum wins the round. The program must include a comprehensive betting system with money management capabilities.

**ðŸ†• UPDATE**: The program has been amended to ensure there is always a clear winner by continuing rounds until someone has more wins than the other, eliminating tie games.

### Core Requirements
- User vs Computer dice game with 2 dice per player per round
- **ðŸ†• UPDATED**: Continue rounds until there's a clear winner (no ties)
- Betting system with three fixed options: 100 SEK, 300 SEK, or 500 SEK
- Money management with deposits up to 5,000 SEK per transaction
- Clear reporting of dice rolls, round winners, and game outcomes
- Prize calculation and total winnings tracking
- Multiple game sessions support
- Random number generation using `rand() % 6 + 1` with proper seeding

## 2. Hidden Assumptions and Requirements Analysis

During the implementation process, several hidden assumptions and requirements were identified and addressed:

### 2.1 Identified Hidden Requirements
1. **Input Validation**: The assignment didn't specify handling invalid user inputs, so comprehensive validation was implemented for bet choices and deposit amounts.

2. **ðŸ†• Tie Elimination**: **UPDATED REQUIREMENT** - The game now continues until there's a definitive winner, ensuring no tie outcomes.

3. **ðŸ†• Extra Rounds Logic**: When the game is tied after 3 rounds, additional rounds are played until someone has more wins.

4. **Money Return on Ties**: **REMOVED** - Since ties are no longer possible, this logic has been eliminated.

5. **Session Management**: The program tracks money across multiple games within a single session, requiring persistent balance tracking.

6. **Round Counting**: **NEW** - The program now tracks and displays the total number of rounds played to reach a winner.

### 2.2 Design Decisions
1. **ðŸ†• Win Condition**: Game continues until `userWins != computerWins`
2. **Win Calculation**: User wins double their bet (user's bet + computer's equivalent bet)
3. **Loss Handling**: User loses their bet (already deducted before game starts)
4. **ðŸ†• No Tie Outcomes**: Simplified logic with only win/lose scenarios
5. **User Experience**: Clear prompts and confirmations for all major actions

## 3. Solution Approach and Implementation Strategy

### 3.1 Program Architecture
The solution was structured using modular functions following the building blocks from Lecture 4:

1. **Main Program Loop**: Controls overall program flow and session management
2. **ðŸ†• Updated Game Logic Module**: Handles individual game execution with guaranteed winner logic
3. **Dice Rolling Function**: Implements random number generation for dice
4. **Money Management Functions**: Handle deposits, betting, and balance tracking
5. **User Interface Functions**: Provide clear output and input handling

### 3.2 Building Blocks Implementation

#### Sequence Building Block
```cpp
int dice1 = rand() % 6 + 1;
int dice2 = rand() % 6 + 1;
return dice1 + dice2;
```
Sequential execution ensures proper dice generation and sum calculation.

#### Selection Building Block
```cpp
if (userRoll > computerRoll) {
    cout << "User wins Round " << round << "!" << endl;
    return 1;
} else if (computerRoll > userRoll) {
    cout << "Computer wins Round " << round << "!" << endl;
    return 2;
} else {
    cout << "Round " << round << " is a tie!" << endl;
    return 0;
}
```
Clear decision-making structure for determining round winners.

#### ðŸ†• Updated Iteration Building Block
```cpp
// OLD LOGIC:
while ((userWins < 2) && (computerWins < 2) && (round <= 3)) {
    // Round execution logic
}

// NEW LOGIC:
while (userWins == computerWins) {
    // Continue until there's a clear winner
}
```
**MAJOR UPDATE**: Efficient loop control implementing guaranteed winner logic.

### 3.3 Random Number Implementation
Following the assignment specifications:
```cpp
#include <ctime>
srand(time(0));  // Seed initialization in main()
rand() % 6 + 1;  // Dice value generation (1-6)
```

## 4. Program Flow and Logic

### 4.1 Main Program Flow
1. **Initialization**: Random seed setup and variable initialization
2. **Session Loop**: Continuous game sessions until user exits
3. **Money Check**: Balance verification and deposit handling
4. **Betting Phase**: Bet selection and validation
5. **ðŸ†• Game Execution**: Continue rounds until clear winner emerges
6. **ðŸ†• Result Processing**: Win/loss calculation (no ties)
7. **Session Control**: Continue/exit decision

### 4.2 ðŸ†• Updated Game Logic Implementation
The guaranteed winner implementation ensures:
- Rounds continue until `userWins != computerWins`
- No tie games possible
- Proper score tracking with round counting
- Clear winner determination

### 4.3 Money Management System
- **Deposit Limit**: Maximum 5,000 SEK per deposit
- **Bet Validation**: Ensures sufficient balance before game starts
- **Balance Tracking**: Persistent across multiple games
- **ðŸ†• Simplified Winnings**: Only win/lose outcomes (no tie returns)

## 5. Strengths and Weaknesses Analysis

### 5.1 Strengths
1. **ðŸ†• Guaranteed Winner**: Eliminates frustrating tie outcomes
