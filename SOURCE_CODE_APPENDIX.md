### Building Blocks Implementation Summary

1. **Sequence Building Block**: Used throughout for sequential execution of statements, particularly in dice rolling and money calculations.

2. **Selection Building Block**: Implemented using if/else statements for:
   - Round winner determination
   - Bet amount validation
   - Game result processing (win/lose/tie outcomes)
   - User choice handling

3. **Iteration Building Block**: Implemented using while loops for:
   - **Game Loop**: `while ((userWins < 2) && (computerWins < 2) && (round <= 3))`
   - **Input Validation**: Loops for bet selection and deposit amounts
   - **Session Management**: Main program loop for multiple games

4. **Logical Operators**: Used && and || operators for complex conditions like:
   - Game loop control with multiple conditions
   - Deposit validation (amount > 0 AND amount <= 5000)
   - Early termination logic (userWins == 2 OR computerWins == 2)

5. **Random Number Generation**: Properly implemented using the specified assignment requirements with srand(time(0)) and rand() % 6 + 1.

### Best-of-3 Implementation Features

#### **Key Logic Components:**
- ✅ **Best-of-3 Rounds**: Maximum 3 rounds per game
- ✅ **Early Termination**: Game ends when someone reaches 2 wins
- ✅ **Round Tie Handling**: Tied rounds award no points, continue to next round
- ✅ **Complete Game Ties**: Rare scenario (1-1 with round 3 tie) returns user's bet
- ✅ **Proper Scoring**: Clear win/lose determination with fair money handling

#### **Assignment Requirements Met:**
- ✅ Three rounds maximum with early termination
- ✅ "Best of three rounds applies" - first to 2 wins
- ✅ "If someone wins two rounds in a row, the third round does not need to be played"
- ✅ All building blocks from Lecture 4 properly implemented
- ✅ Random number generation as specified
- ✅ Money management with deposit limits and betting system
1. **Play rounds until `userWins != computerWins`**
2. **No tie outcomes possible**
3. **Clear winner determination**
4. **Simplified result processing**

### Code Quality Features

- **Comprehensive Comments**: Every function and major code block includes detailed explanations of the updates
- **Modular Design**: Code remains organized into logical functions for maintainability
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated with appropriate error handling
- **Clear Output**: Enhanced user-friendly messages showing round progress and winner determination
- **Building Block Integration**: Proper use of all required C++ constructs from Lecture 4 with updated logic
